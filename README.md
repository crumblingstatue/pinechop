A calculator that doesn't confuse unary negation and binary substraction

Once upon a time, I created a calculator called RC.

It was so poorly designed, `2 - 2` and `2-2` yielded different results (`0` and `-2` respectively).
It was so unsalvageable that I DELETED EVERYTHING, and started a new calculator from scratch.
This is that calculator.
